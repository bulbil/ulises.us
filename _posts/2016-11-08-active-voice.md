*Active Voice* considers the voice in relation to listening, language, and political agency through a series of programs, artworks, readings, events, and curated publications from contributors Mark Beasley, Hannah Black, and Steffani Jemison. *Active Voice* seeks to address the performative and embodied potential of the voice and it's ability to reify and limit political and social realities.

#### CONTRIBUTORS

HANNAH BLACK presents a selection of recent video works – including *Intensive Care/Hot New Track, Fall of Communism, and My Bodies* – that consider pop vocals as a space to explore violence, power, and pluralism.


STEFFANI JEMISON presents her 2014 two-channel sound piece, *Same Time*, a reprisal of a speech delivered in 1970 by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton that has been reinterpreted by Brooklyn-based R&B group Sidetrack Boyz as a vocal improvisation. 


MARK BEASLEY presents *Re-Voice*, a curated selection of books and records on the theme of voice.
