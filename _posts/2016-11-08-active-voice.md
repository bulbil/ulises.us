*Active Voice* considers the voice in relation to listening, language, and political agency through a series of programs, artworks, readings, events, and curated publications from contributors Mark Beasley, Hannah Black, and Steffani Jemison. *Active Voice* seeks to address the performative and embodied potential of the voice and it's ability to reify and limit political and social realities.
